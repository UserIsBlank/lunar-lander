> This project is a deep learning model that classifies images as either cats or dogs. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn features that distinguish between the two classes, training on labeled images of cats and dogs. The model aims to achieve high accuracy and is implemented in Python using popular machine learning libraries.
## Introduction
> The Cat or Dog Classifier project is a common introductory deep learning problem, allowing you to work with a simple dataset and build an effective model for image classification. The classifier is trained to predict if an image contains a cat or a dog, leveraging a CNN for feature extraction and classification.
## Installation Dependencies
> To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:
> * TensorFlow
> * numpy
